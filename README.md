## ðŸ“ˆ How It Works

### 1. Select Annual Income
- Choose your income range from dropdown.
- The tax rate will update based on the selected range.

### 2. Calculate Capital Gains
Formula used: Capital Gains = Sale Price - Purchase Price - Expenses

### 3. Choose Investment Type
- **Short Term**: Full capital gains are considered for tax.
- **Long Term**: 
  - If gains are positive, 50% discount is applied.
  - Net Capital Gains = Capital Gains - 50% of Capital Gains

### 4. Tax Calculation
